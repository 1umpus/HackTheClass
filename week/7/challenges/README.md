# Forensics Challenges

## Full physical:
### The crime lab has just received this disk image of a thumb drive. Can you find the flag?

## Hidden in plain sight:
### The perp thought he'd get away with the crime. Prove that he can't! Can you find the hidden file?

## Network
### We also captured the perp's network traffic... what website did he visit before we seized his laptop?

## Network II
### He downloaded a file, didn't he. Find it!

## Gibberish
### Wait... did he encrypt a file? What is he HIDING!


## Change the channel
### Ah, nice find. You recovered the secret. But wait! There's more...
