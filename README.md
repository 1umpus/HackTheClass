![HackTheClass](HackTheClass.png)

## Course Description
This practical, hands-on 1-credit course provides students with a foundation on
ethical hacking. The course begins with a discussion on the ethics behind security
research and progresses to topics that surround penetration testing, forensics,
cryptology, and binary reverse engineering and exploitation. This course is also
meant to introduce students to Capture-the-Flag (CTF) style cybersecurity challenges, encourages participation in UMD's Cybersecurity Club ([UMDCSEC](https://csec.umd.edu)), and prepares for CMSC414.

## Academic Integrity
Note that academic dishonesty includes not only cheating, fabrication, and plagiarism, but also includes helping other students commit acts of academic dishonesty by allowing them to obtain copies of your work. In short, all submitted work must be your own. Cases of academic dishonesty will be pursued to the fullest extent possible as stipulated by the <a href="http://osc.umd.edu/OSC/Default.aspx">Office of Student Conduct</a>.

It is very important for you to be aware of the consequences of cheating, fabrication, facilitation, and plagiarism. For more information on the Code of Academic Integrity or the Student Honor Council, please visit http://www.shc.umd.edu.
