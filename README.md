![HackTheClass](HackTheClass.png)

## Course Description
This practical, hands-on [1-credit course](http://sticsumd.com/) provides students with a foundation on ethical hacking. The course begins with a discussion on the ethics behind security research and progresses to topics that surround penetration testing, forensics, cryptology, and binary reverse engineering and exploitation. This course is also meant to introduce students to Capture-the-Flag (CTF) style cybersecurity challenges, encourages participation in UMD's Cybersecurity Club ([UMDCSEC](https://csec.umd.edu)), and prepares for CMSC414.

## Grading
Grades will be maintained on the CS Department grades server.

You are responsible for all material discussed in lecture and posted on the class repository, including announcements, deadlines, policies, etc.

Your final course grade will be determined according to the following percentages:

| Percentage | Title | Description |
| ------------- | -----|-------- |
| 75% | Write-ups  | Weekly individual write-ups (250-500 words) that summarize the lecture and assigned CTF challenges. |
| 25% | Final Hack | Demonstrate mastery of all topics learned and apply knowledge to change your grade on the class's private grade server. The grade earned will be determined by levels unlocked in the grade server and will be applied to your official final grade. |

Any request for reconsideration of any grading on coursework must be submitted within one week of when it is returned. No requests will be considered afterwards.

## Academic Integrity
Note that academic dishonesty includes not only cheating, fabrication, and plagiarism, but also includes helping other students commit acts of academic dishonesty by allowing them to obtain copies of your work. In short, all submitted work must be your own. Cases of academic dishonesty will be pursued to the fullest extent possible as stipulated by the <a href="http://osc.umd.edu/OSC/Default.aspx">Office of Student Conduct</a>.

It is very important for you to be aware of the consequences of cheating, fabrication, facilitation, and plagiarism. For more information on the Code of Academic Integrity or the Student Honor Council, please visit http://www.shc.umd.edu.
